# object-oriented-programming

## What is an Object-Oriented Programming?

OOP is a programming _paradigm_ or style of programming centered around _objects_ rather than functions.
OOP is not a programming language or a tool!

## Languages

There are many programming languages up there that support object-oriented programming, like:

- C#
- Java
- Ruby
- Python
- JavaScript, and more

## Procedural Programming VS Object-Oriented Programming

Before Object-Oriented programming we had Procedural Programming that divided a program into a set of functions
so, you got a bunch of data store in a variables, and functions that operate on the data.
this style of programming is a very simple and straight forward.
you end up with functions that dependents on each other and if you make a little change everything breaks.
Object-oriented programming came to solve this problem.

## How OOP works?

in oop we combine a group of related variables and functions into a unit, we call that unit an object.
in objects, we refer variables as properties and functions as methods.

## Objects in the real life

Think on objects like objects in the real life.
A person is an object, he got properties like name, age, address, etc.
he also has methods like walk(), eat(), sleep(), etc...

## OOP Core concepts

OOP builds around this core concepts:

- Encapsulation
- Abstractions
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Encapsulation

"The best functions are those with no parameters!" Uncle Bob - Robert C Martin

## Abstraction

Hiding some properties and methods from the outside and showing only the essential
benefits:

- Simpler Interface
- Reduce the impact of change

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism that allows you to eliminate redundant code.

## Polymorphism

Poly = many
Morph = Form
polymorphism is a technique that helps you get rid of long if and else or Switch case statements.
in object-oriented programming we can create objects with a different behavior and then produce different result.

## Benefits of OOP

- Encapsulation
  - we group related variables and functions together; in this way we can reduce complexity.
  - now we can reuse this unit / object in a different part of the application.
- Abstraction
  - hide the details and the complexity and show only the essential.
  - reduce complexity + reduce the impact of changes in the code
- Inheritance
  - eliminate redundant code
- Polymorphism
  - Refactor conditional statements
